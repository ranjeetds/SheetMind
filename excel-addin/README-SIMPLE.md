```

### **Step 2: Open SheetMind AI**

1. **Open Excel Online:** https://office.com

## ðŸŽ¯ **How It Works**

## ðŸ›  **Troubleshooting**

### **"Page won't load"**
- Make sure both servers are running
- Try: http://127.0.0.1:3000/standalone-app.html

### **"Not connecting to Excel"**
- Use **Excel Online** (office.com) - most reliable
- Make sure Excel is open in another browser tab
- Refresh the SheetMind page

### **"Commands not working"**
- Basic commands work without AI backend
- For AI commands, ensure backend server is running
- Check console for any error messages
